# Python_Command_Terminal
This project is a Python-inspired command terminal built as a web application. It mimics the behavior of a real system terminal while providing a clean, interactive interface for executing commands. The terminal supports a variety of commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `pwd`, `echo`, and `exit`, along with simulated system information.
